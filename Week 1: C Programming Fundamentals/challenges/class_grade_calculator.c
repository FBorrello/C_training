/*Requirements:

Use functions to modularize your code (e.g., one for calculating the average, one for determining the grade).
Use a switch or if statements for grade assignment.
Store names in character arrays (e.g., char name[50]).
Commit your code to your Git repo with clear comments and a README*/

    /*Calculate the average score for each student and assign a letter grade (A: 90–100, B: 80–89, C: 70–79, D: 60–69, F: <60).*/
    /*Print a formatted report with each student’s name, average score, and letter grade.*/
    /*Handle errors: reject invalid scores (outside 0–100) and ensure the number of students is positive.*/
