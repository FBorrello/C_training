# C Programming Training Progress Log

This file tracks my daily progress in C programming quizzes, with the goal of maintaining a 70% success rate per sub-topic and increasing difficulty as I improve. Each session includes quiz results, sub-topic scores, overall performance, weak areas, notes for improvement, and the current difficulty level. The log is maintained in a public repository to ensure continuity across sessions.

## Session: July 1, 2025

**Date and Time**: July 1, 2025, 04:42 PM CEST

**Difficulty Level**: Very Hard

**Sub-Topic Scores**:

- **Fundamentals**: 5/5 (100%)
- **Control Structures**: 7/10 (70%)
- **Arrays**: 10/13 (76.92%)
- **Pointers**: 6/8 (75%)
- **Functions**: 5/5 (100%)
- **Strings**: 9/12 (75%)
- **Structures**: 5/5 (100%)
- **File Handling**: 5/5 (100%)
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: 7/8 (87.5%)
- **Preprocessing**: 6/7 (85.71%)

**Overall Score**: 65/83 (78.31%)

**Weak Areas**: None (all sub-topics ≥ 70%)

**Notes**:

- Strong performance across all sub-topics, with Fundamentals, Functions, Structures, and File Handling at 100%.
- Control Structures (70%), Pointers (75%), and Strings (75%) are close to the 70% threshold; monitor these for mastery with challenging quizzes.
- Recent improvements in Arrays (from 57.14% to 76.92%) and Control Structures (from 62.5% to 70%) show progress in pointer arithmetic and loop logic.
- Assigned Quizzes 83–92 (very hard) to match overall performance.

## Session: July 2, 2025

**Date and Time**: July 2, 2025, 04:47 PM CEST

**Difficulty Level**: Very Hard

**Sub-Topic Scores**:

- **Fundamentals**: 6/6 (100%)
- **Control Structures**: 7/11 (63.64%)
- **Arrays**: 11/14 (78.57%)
- **Pointers**: 7/9 (77.78%)
- **Functions**: 6/6 (100%)
- **Strings**: 10/13 (76.92%)
- **Structures**: 6/6 (100%)
- **File Handling**: 6/6 (100%)
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: 8/9 (88.89%)
- **Preprocessing**: 7/8 (87.5%)

**Overall Score**: 74/93 (79.57%)

**Weak Areas**: Control Structures (63.64%)

**Notes**:

- Excellent performance on Quizzes 83–92 (9/10 correct), improving overall score to 79.57%.
- Control Structures dropped to 63.64% due to an error in Quiz 84 (miscalculated loop sum with bitwise and `continue`). Reinforcement needed.
- Strong performance in Fundamentals, Functions, Structures, and File Handling (100%).
- Arrays, Pointers, Strings, and Preprocessing remain solid (76–88%); continue monitoring with challenging quizzes.
- Difficulty level (Very Hard) is appropriate given the 79.57% overall score. Next session will include reinforcement for Control Structures.

**Next Steps**:

- Provide reinforcement quizzes for Control Structures to bring it above 70%.
- Submit answers for new quizzes in the next session.
- Share this summary or repository link at the start of the next session to ensure continuity.
