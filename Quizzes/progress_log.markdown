# C Programming Training Progress Log

This file tracks my daily progress in C programming quizzes and challenges, with the goal of maintaining a 70% success rate per sub-topic and increasing difficulty as I improve. Each session includes quiz results, sub-topic scores, overall performance, weak areas, notes for improvement, and the current difficulty level. The log is maintained in a public repository to ensure continuity across sessions.

## Session: July 5, 2025

**Date and Time**: July 5, 2025, 10:15 AM CEST

**Difficulty Level**: Extremely Hard

**Sub-Topic Scores** (Updated):
- **Fundamentals**: 6/6 (100%) [unchanged]
- **Control Structures**: 22/28 (78.57%) [21/27 + 1/1 (Q3)]
- **Arrays**: 17/20 (85%) [unchanged]
- **Pointers**: 30/36 (83.33%) [26/32 + 2/2 (Q2, Q5) + 2/2 (Challenge)]
- **Functions**: 9/9 (100%) [unchanged]
- **Strings**: 16.5/20 (82.5%) [unchanged]
- **Structures**: 8/9 (88.89%) [unchanged]
- **File Handling**: 8/8 (100%) [unchanged]
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: 15/18 (83.33%) [unchanged]
- **Preprocessing**: 9/10 (90%) [unchanged]
- **Bit Fields**: 1/1 (100%) [unchanged]
- **Volatile Variables**: 3/4 (75%) [1/2 + 2/2 (Q1, Q4)]
- **IoT Protocols**: 2/2 (100%) [1/1 + 1/1 (Q6)]
- **Embedded AI**: 2/2 (100%) [1/1 + 1/1 (Q7)]
- **Memory-Mapped I/O**: 1/1 (100%) [0/0 + 1/1 (Q8)]
- **DMA**: 1/1 (100%) [0/0 + 1/1 (Q9)]
- **Real-Time Constraints**: 1/1 (100%) [0/0 + 1/1 (Q10)]
- **Challenge (Pointers)**: 7/8 (87.5%) [3/4 + 4/4 (New Challenge)]

**Overall Score**: 156/184 (84.78%) [142/170 + 14/14 (Quizzes + Challenge)]

**Weak Areas**:
- **Control Structures (78.57%)**: Improved slightly but still below 90%. Needs focus on bit manipulation and edge cases.
- **Pointers (83.33%)**: Strong today, but function pointers and complex buffer management could use reinforcement.
- **Strings (82.5%)**: No quizzes today; revisit in future sessions.

**Notes**:
- Achieved 100% on quizzes and code challenge, exceeding the 90% session target.
- Expanded scope to include Memory-Mapped I/O, DMA, and Real-Time Constraints, handled excellently.
- Volatile Variables improved to 75%, showing progress but not yet at 90%.
- Overall score rose to 84.78%, nearing the 90% goal.
- Code challenge showcased excellent interrupt-driven system design.
- Using an online compiler; consider specifying hardware (e.g., ESP32, STM32) for future challenges.

**Next Steps**:
- **Control Structures**: Add 2 quizzes on advanced bit manipulation and edge cases.
- **Pointers**: Add 1 quiz on function pointers in callbacks.
- **Volatile Variables**: Add 1 quiz on shared variable access in interrupt-driven systems.
- **Strings**: Add 1 quiz on string parsing for IoT (e.g., JSON for MQTT).
- **New Topics**: Introduce quizzes on low-power modes, watchdog timers, or embedded AI optimization.
- **Challenge**: Design a Control Structures-based IoT task (e.g., GPIO bit-level sensor control).
- **Environment**: Share hardware details for tailored challenges.
- Share this log at the next sessionâ€™s start.
