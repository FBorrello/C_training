# C Programming Training Progress Log

This file tracks my daily progress in C programming quizzes, with the goal of maintaining a 70% success rate per sub-topic and increasing difficulty as I improve. Each session includes quiz results, sub-topic scores, overall performance, weak areas, notes for improvement, and the current difficulty level. The log is maintained in a public repository to ensure continuity across sessions.

## Session: July 2, 2025

**Date and Time**: July 2, 2025, 3:09 PM CEST

**Difficulty Level**: Extremely Hard

**Sub-Topic Scores**:
- **Fundamentals**: 6/6 (100%) [unchanged]
- **Control Structures**: 14/20 (70%) [updated: 13/19 + 1/1 (R4)]
- **Arrays**: 13/16 (81.25%) [unchanged]
- **Pointers**: 9/11 (81.82%) [unchanged]
- **Functions**: 8/8 (100%) [unchanged]
- **Strings**: 11/14 (78.57%) [unchanged]
- **Structures**: 8/9 (88.89%) [unchanged]
- **File Handling**: 8/8 (100%) [unchanged]
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: 10/11 (90.91%) [unchanged]
- **Preprocessing**: 9/10 (90%) [unchanged]
- **Challenge (Control Structures)**: 1/1 (100%) [updated: revised challenge]

**Overall Score**: 98/118 (83.05%) [updated: 97/117 + 1/1 (R4) + 1/1 (challenge)]

**Weak Areas**: None (all sub-topics ≥ 70%)

**Notes**:
- Strong performance on Quizzes 103–112 (9/10, 90%) and reinforcement quizzes (4/4, 100%) at Extremely Hard difficulty.
- Control Structures reached 70% with correct R4 answer, addressing previous weakness ( NPS: I believe you meant 68.42% here).
- Structures at 88.89% after correct reinforcement quiz.
- Revised challenge (100%) fixed printing logic, producing correct triangular pattern with bitwise operations.
- Overall score improved to 83.05%, approaching 90% target.
- Extremely Hard difficulty was effective; minor typos in quiz options (Q6, R4) did not impact learning due to correct logic.

**Next Steps**:
- Continue Extremely Hard difficulty in next session, with 3–4 Control Structures quizzes to solidify 90% performance.
- Challenge Arrays (81.25%), Pointers (81.82%), and Strings (78.57%) to reach 90%.
- Share progress log at the start of the next session.
