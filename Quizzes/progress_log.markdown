# C Programming Training Progress Log

This file tracks my daily progress in C programming quizzes, with the goal of maintaining a 70% success rate per sub-topic and increasing difficulty as I improve. Each session includes quiz results, sub-topic scores, overall performance, weak areas, notes for improvement, and the current difficulty level. The log is maintained in a public repository to ensure continuity across sessions.

## Session: July 2, 2025

**Date and Time**: July 2, 2025, 10:44 AM CEST

**Difficulty Level**: Very Hard

**Sub-Topic Scores**:
- **Fundamentals**: 6/6 (100%) [unchanged]
- **Control Structures**: 10/14 (71.43%) [updated: 7/11 + 2/2 + 1/1 (challenge)]
- **Arrays**: 12/15 (80%) [updated: 11/14 + 1/1]
- **Pointers**: 8/10 (80%) [updated: 7/9 + 1/1]
- **Functions**: 7/7 (100%) [updated: 6/6 + 1/1]
- **Strings**: 11/14 (78.57%) [updated: 10/13 + 1/1]
- **Structures**: 7/7 (100%) [updated: 6/6 + 1/1]
- **File Handling**: 7/7 (100%) [updated: 6/6 + 1/1]
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: 9/10 (90%) [updated: 8/9 + 1/1]
- **Preprocessing**: 8/9 (88.89%) [updated: 7/8 + 1/1]

**Overall Score**: 85/104 (81.73%) [updated: 74/93 + 10/10 + 1/1 (challenge)]

**Weak Areas**: None (all sub-topics ≥ 70%)

**Notes**:
- Perfect performance on Quizzes 93–102 (10/10, 100%), improving overall score to 81.73%.
- Control Structures improved from 63.64% to 71.43% with strong quiz performance (100%) and challenge (90%). Minor formatting issue in challenge (missing spaces) prevented perfect score.
- All other sub-topics remain strong (80–100%); Arrays (80%), Pointers (80%), Strings (78.57%), and Dynamic Memory Allocation (90%) are approaching 90% target.
- Challenge problem demonstrated solid Control Structures understanding, addressing previous weakness.
- Difficulty level (Very Hard) remains appropriate given 81.73% overall score.

**Next Steps**:
- Focus on formatting precision in output (e.g., adding spaces between numbers).
- Continue challenging Control Structures quizzes to solidify 90%+ performance.
