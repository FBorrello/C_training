# C Programming Training Progress Log

This file tracks my daily progress in C programming quizzes and challenges, with the goal of maintaining a 70% success rate per sub-topic and increasing difficulty as I improve. Each session includes quiz results, sub-topic scores, overall performance, weak areas, notes for improvement, and the current difficulty level. The log is maintained in a public repository to ensure continuity across sessions.

## Session: July 3, 2025

**Date and Time**: July 3, 2025, 05:10 PM CEST

**Difficulty Level**: Extremely Hard

**Sub-Topic Scores**:
- **Fundamentals**: 6/6 (100%) [unchanged]
- **Control Structures**: 19/25 (76%) [18/24 + 1/1 (Q9)]
- **Arrays**: 16/19 (84.21%) [15/18 + 1/1 (Q6)]
- **Pointers**: 20/26 (76.92%) [14/20 + 4/4 (Q1, Q4, Q7, Q10) + 1/1 (previous Challenge) + 1/1 (current Challenge)]
- **Functions**: 8/8 (100%) [unchanged]
- **Strings**: 15.5/19 (81.58%) [13.5/17 + 2/2 (Q2, Q5)]
- **Structures**: 8/9 (88.89%) [unchanged]
- **File Handling**: 8/8 (100%) [unchanged]
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: 13/16 (81.25%) [11/14 + 2/2 (Q3, Q8)]
- **Preprocessing**: 9/10 (90%) [unchanged]
- **Challenge (Pointers)**: 2/3 (66.67%) [0/1 (swap function) + 1/1 (process_sensor_data) + 1/1 (filter_sensor_data)]

**Overall Score**: 124/150 (82.67%) [112/139 + 10/10 (Q1–Q10) + 1/1 (previous Challenge) + 1/1 (current Challenge)]

**Weak Areas**:
- **Pointers (76.92%)**: Improved from 73.08% with successful `filter_sensor_data` resubmission, fixing uninitialized `*out_size` and excessive output issues. However, the initial challenge failure and previous swap function error indicate gaps in complex pointer manipulation (e.g., multi-level pointers, output parameter initialization).
- **Arrays (84.21%)**: Strong performance, up from 83.33% with correct Q6, but ensure consistency in pointer-based array tasks.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation (81.25%)**: Solid, but continue monitoring variable/parameter initialization to avoid undefined behavior.
- **Strings (81.58%)**: Improved from 79.41%, but watch for edge cases in character processing (e.g., non-alphabetic characters).

**Notes**:
- Achieved 100% (10/10) on quizzes, demonstrating mastery of extremely hard concepts across Pointers, Arrays, Strings, Dynamic Memory Allocation, and Control Structures.
- Initial `filter_sensor_data` challenge submission failed due to uninitialized `*out_size` and excessive `printf` statements, but resubmission was correct, showing strong learning progress.
- Question about output array bounds checking reflects excellent awareness of embedded system constraints, critical for IoT applications.
- Overall score (82.67%) improved from 80.58%, but the 66.67% challenge score (due to earlier swap function error) keeps the target of 90% out of reach.
- Progress in Pointers is notable, with successful challenge resubmissions, but complex tasks require further reinforcement.

**Next Steps**:
- **Pointers**: Focus 3 quizzes on multi-level pointers, pointer-based data structures, and IoT data processing (e.g., sensor parsing) to address complex manipulation gaps.
- **Arrays**: Include 1 quiz on pointer-based 2D array manipulation to maintain 84.21% strength.
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Include 1–2 quizzes on memory safety and parameter initialization.
- **Strings**: Include 1–2 quizzes on edge cases (e.g., mixed character sets, null-terminated strings).
- **Control Structures**: Include 2 quizzes on bit manipulation and complex conditionals for embedded systems.
- **Challenge**: Provide a new Pointers-based IoT task (e.g., sorting sensor data using pointer arithmetic) with emphasis on bounds checking and memory safety.
- **Environment**: Share compiler/hardware setup (e.g., Arduino, STM32, online compiler) to tailor quizzes/challenges for memory constraints or platform-specific requirements.
- Share this updated progress log at the start of the next session.
