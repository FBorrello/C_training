C Programming Training Progress Log
This file tracks my daily progress in C programming quizzes and challenges, with the goal of maintaining a 70% success rate per sub-topic and increasing difficulty as I improve. Each session includes quiz results, sub-topic scores, overall performance, weak areas, notes for improvement, and the current difficulty level. The log is maintained in a public repository to ensure continuity across sessions.
Session: July 6, 2025
Date and Time: July 6, 2025, 12:30 PM CEST
Difficulty Level: Extremely Hard
Sub-Topic Scores:

Fundamentals: 6/6 (100%)
Control Structures: 29/34 (85.29%)
Arrays: 17/20 (85%)
Pointers: 31/37 (83.78%)
Functions: 9/9 (100%)
Strings: 17.5/21 (83.33%)
Structures: 8/9 (88.89%)
File Handling: 8/8 (100%)
Dynamic Memory Allocation: 15/18 (83.33%)
Preprocessing: 9/10 (90%)
Bit Fields: 1/1 (100%)
Volatile Variables: 4/5 (80%)
IoT Protocols: 2/2 (100%)
Embedded AI: 2/2 (100%)
Memory-Mapped I/O: 1/2 (50%)
DMA: 2/2 (100%)
Real-Time Constraints: 2/2 (100%)
Low-Power Modes: 1/1 (100%)
Watchdog Timers: 1/1 (100%)
Challenge (Control Structures): 11/12 (91.67%)

Overall Score: 170/198 (85.86%)
Weak Areas:

Memory-Mapped I/O (50%): Missed quiz on bit-shifting; needs reinforcement in GPIO manipulation and volatile register access.
Control Structures (85.29%): Improved significantly with perfect challenge score; maintain consistency in complex bit manipulation and edge cases.
Pointers (83.78%): Strong in quizzes but needs practice with volatile pointers in complex embedded scenarios.
Strings (83.33%): Stable; reinforce IoT-related parsing (e.g., JSON, MQTT payloads).
Volatile Variables (80%): Improved but below 90%; focus on safe handling in interrupt-driven systems.

Notes:

Achieved 90% on quizzes (9/10) and 100% on the challenge (4/4), improving overall score to 85.86%, nearing the 90% goal.
Challenge (GPIO sensor control) demonstrated mastery of bit manipulation ((*GPIO_SENSOR >> 8) & 0xFF) and volatile pointers, with robust edge case handling (sensor_id >= 8 explicitly sets *status = 0).
Minor style improvement: Use || instead of | for logical conditions in future code.
Missed Quiz 8 (Memory-Mapped I/O) due to bit-shifting error; indicates need for targeted practice.
Strong performance in new topics: Low-Power Modes and Watchdog Timers (100%).
Using an online compiler; recommend specifying hardware (e.g., ESP32, STM32) for tailored challenges.

Next Steps:

Memory-Mapped I/O: Add 2 quizzes on bit-shifting and GPIO register manipulation.
Control Structures: Add 1 quiz on bit manipulation edge cases in IoT contexts.
Pointers: Add 1 quiz on volatile pointer handling in embedded systems.
Volatile Variables: Add 1 quiz on safe handling in interrupt-driven systems.
Strings: Add 1 quiz on MQTT payload parsing.
New Topics: Introduce quizzes on task scheduling or embedded AI inference optimization.
Challenge: Design a Memory-Mapped I/O task (e.g., GPIO configuration for sensor interrupts).
Environment: Share hardware details (e.g., ESP32, STM32) for tailored challenges.
Share this log at the start of the next session.
