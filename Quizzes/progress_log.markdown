# C Programming Training Progress Log

This file tracks my daily progress in C programming quizzes, with the goal of maintaining a 70% success rate per sub-topic and increasing difficulty as I improve. Each session includes quiz results, sub-topic scores, overall performance, weak areas, notes for improvement, and the current difficulty level. The log is maintained in a public repository to ensure continuity across sessions.

## Session: July 3, 2025

**Date and Time**: July 3, 2025, 09:43 AM CEST

**Difficulty Level**: Extremely Hard

**Sub-Topic Scores**:
- **Fundamentals**: 6/6 (100%) [unchanged]
- **Control Structures**: 18/24 (75%) [updated: 14/20 + 4/4 (Q1, Q5, Q9, R1)]
- **Arrays**: 15/18 (83.33%) [updated: 13/16 + 2/2 (Q2, Q6)]
- **Pointers**: 14/20 (70%) [updated: 9/11 + 5/9 (Q3, Q7, R2, R5, R6, R8, R9, R10, Challenge)]
- **Functions**: 8/8 (100%) [unchanged]
- **Strings**: 13.5/17 (79.41%) [updated: 11/14 + 2.5/3 (Q4, Q8, R4)]
- **Structures**: 8/9 (88.89%) [unchanged]
- **File Handling**: 8/8 (100%) [unchanged]
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: 11/14 (78.57%) [updated: 10/11 + 1/3 (Q10, R3, R7)]
- **Preprocessing**: 9/10 (90%) [unchanged]
- **Challenge (Pointers)**: 0/1 (0%) [updated: incorrect swap function]

**Overall Score**: 112/139 (80.58%) [updated: 98/118 + 14/21 (Q1–Q10, R1–R10, Challenge)]

**Weak Areas**: 
- **Pointers (70%)**: Reached 70% with correct R10, but errors in uninitialized pointers (Q7), pointer assignment (R2), NULL pointer dereference (R8), and incorrect swap function (Challenge) indicate ongoing challenges.
- **Strings (79.41%)**: Minor issue in R4 (counting non-alphabetic characters as consonants).
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation (78.57%)**: Earlier errors (Q10, R3) suggest gaps in null checks.

**Notes**:
- Strong performance in Arrays (83.33%) and Control Structures (75%), with R1 corrected after catching evaluator’s error in answer key.
- Pointers improved to 70% with correct R9 and R10, showing progress in tracking pointer assignments, but errors in Q7, R2, R8, and Challenge indicate need for further practice.
- Strings (79.41%) solid, but R4 missed excluding non-alphabetic characters.
- Dynamic Memory Allocation (78.57%) improved with correct R7, but earlier errors need attention.
- End challenge (Pointers) was incorrect due to manipulating pointers instead of values and missing return value.
- Typo in R9 (`izz` instead of `int`) was caught, showing good attention to detail.
- Overall score (80.58%) is close to 90% target, but Pointers requires continued focus.

**Next Steps**:
- Next session: Focus 3–4 quizzes on Pointers to address dereferencing, assignment, and manipulation, aiming for 90%.
- Include 1–2 quizzes on Strings and Dynamic Memory Allocation to push above 80%.
- Challenge Pointers (e.g., pointer-based array manipulation) to solidify weak area.
- Share progress log at the start of the next session.
