# C Programming Training Progress Log

This file tracks my daily progress in C programming quizzes and challenges, with the goal of maintaining a 70% success rate per sub-topic and increasing difficulty as I improve. Each session includes quiz results, sub-topic scores, overall performance, weak areas, notes for improvement, and the current difficulty level. The log is maintained in a public repository to ensure continuity across sessions.

## Session: July 4, 2025

**Date and Time**: July 4, 2025, 3:50 PM CEST

**Difficulty Level**: Extremely Hard

**Sub-Topic Scores**:
- **Fundamentals**: 6/6 (100%) [unchanged]
- **Control Structures**: 21/27 (77.78%) [20/26 + 1/1 (Q8)]
- **Arrays**: 17/20 (85%) [unchanged]
- **Pointers**: 26/32 (81.25%) [23/29 + 3/3 (Q4, Q9, Challenge placeholder)]
- **Functions**: 9/9 (100%) [8/8 + 1/1 (Q1)]
- **Strings**: 16.5/20 (82.5%) [unchanged]
- **Structures**: 8/9 (88.89%) [unchanged]
- **File Handling**: 8/8 (100%) [unchanged]
- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: 15/18 (83.33%) [14/17 + 1/1 (Q6)]
- **Preprocessing**: 9/10 (90%) [unchanged]
- **Bit Fields**: 1/1 (100%) [0/0 + 1/1 (Q2)]
- **Volatile Variables**: 1/2 (50%) [0/0 + 1/2 (Q3, Q10)]
- **IoT Protocols**: 1/1 (100%) [0/0 + 1/1 (Q5)]
- **Embedded AI**: 1/1 (100%) [0/0 + 1/1 (Q7)]
- **Challenge (Pointers)**: 3/4 (75%) [3/4, awaiting Challenge submission]

**Overall Score**: 142/170 (83.53%) [133/160 + 9/10 (Q1â€“Q10) + 0/0 (Challenge pending)]

**Weak Areas**:
- **Volatile Variables (50%)**: Incorrect answer in Q3 indicates a need to understand `volatile` behavior in interrupt-driven systems.
- **Pointers (81.25%)**: Strong but not yet at 90%; function pointers and circular buffers need practice.
- **Control Structures (77.78%)**: Consistent but requires attention to detail to avoid errors like Q3.

**Notes**:
- Achieved 9/10 (90%) on quizzes, hitting the target success rate for this session.
- Expanded scope to include function pointers, bit fields, volatile variables, and IoT/AI topics, which kept the session engaging.
- Error in Q3 (Volatile Variables) suggests a need to reinforce interrupt-related concepts.
- Overall score improved to 83.53%, but the 90% target requires consistent challenge success.
- Awaiting code challenge submission for circular buffer implementation.
- Using an online compiler; consider specifying a target hardware platform (e.g., ESP32, STM32) for more tailored IoT challenges.

**Next Steps**:
- **Volatile Variables**: Include 2 quizzes on interrupt-driven scenarios and volatile variable usage.
- **Pointers**: Include 2 quizzes on function pointers and circular buffers to push toward 90%.
- **Control Structures**: Include 1 quiz on bit manipulation to reinforce precision.
- **IoT Protocols**: Include 1 quiz on MQTT/CoAP packet processing.
- **Embedded AI**: Include 1 quiz on fixed-point arithmetic for AI inference.
- **Challenge**: Complete the circular buffer challenge and focus on a new Pointers-based IoT task (e.g., interrupt-driven sensor data processing).
- **Environment**: Share specific hardware details to tailor future challenges for embedded constraints.
- Share this updated progress log at the start of the next session.
